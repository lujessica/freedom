        <note>In this article, Saidiya Hartman theorizes archival violence and its disproportionate impact on the lives of Black women. Hartman argues that archival traces and texts corroborate representations of Black women as always dead or dying, if not in relentless peril. Such violence dehumanizes Black women, not just in the historical record, but also in contemporary life. This theorizing of archival violence contributes to this digital surrogate insofar as every attempt has been made to recognize and amplify the human activities and accomplishments of Black women, with particular attention paid to their life experiences beyond suffering and pain.</note>

      <div type="1920s">
        <p>1920s: Short, flapper-esque haircuts, Marcel Waves, finger waves, and wigs were popular.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="1930s">
        <p>1930s: Straightened, short hair with curls, waves, or finger waves lived on. Switches (hairpieces) and wigs were also used to mimic straight styles.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="1940s">
        <p>1940s: Hair was kept short and straight, with added curls. The croquignole curl was particularly hip. Women also wore pageboys and wavy hair.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="1950s">
        <p>1950s: Black nationalism slowly started to bubble back up, and straightening black hair was a topic for debate. Straightened, mainstream styles remained popular due to society’s Eurocentric beauty ideals.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="1960s">
        <p>1960s: Natural hair became politicized during the civil rights movement as a rejection of Eurocentric beauty standards. The Afros of activists like the <orgName xml:id="BP">Black Panthers</orgName> became an inspiring symbol of rebellion. People were still straightening their hair, though.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="1970s">
        <p>1970s: Afros started to become more of a fashion choice. Black celebrities like <persName xml:id="DR">Diana Ross</persName> and <persName xml:id="PG">Pam Grier</persName> rocked afros in style. In 1973, <persName xml:id="CT">Cicely Tyson</persName> appeared on the cover of <orgName xml:id="JM">Jet Magazine</orgName> with a stunning, traditionally African hairstyle.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="1980s">
        <p>1980s: The afros became less ubiquitous, but the curls were still in. People gravitated toward lesser-textured curls, or Jheri curls. Asymmetric haircuts, like those seen on <orgName type="group-name" xml:id="SNP">Salt-N-Pepa</orgName>, were also hot in the streets.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="1990s">
        <p>1990s: Straight hair was still popular, but black women were also wearing braids, styling their baby hairs with gel or pomade. Box braids worn by <persName xml:id="JJ">Janet Jackson</persName> in <name type="movie-name">Poetic Justice</name> remain an iconic ’90s look.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="2000s">
        <p>2000s: The rise of online communities and <orgName ref="#YT">YouTube</orgName> facilitated a natural hair “revolution.” Straight styles were still fashionable, but more black women looked for ways to style their natural kinks. Cornrows, sometimes braided in intricate patterns as seen on celebrities like <persName xml:id="AK">Alicia Keys</persName>, were popular.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="2010s">
        <p>2010s: Demand for relaxers continues to drop and natural hairstyles have become more popular than ever… glamorized by YouTube hair gurus and celebrities alike. Braids, twist-outs, bantu knots, locs, and curly Afros are just a few of the many styles black women play with these days.</p>
