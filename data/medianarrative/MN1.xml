         <p>I treat young people committing offenses very seriously - and I don't believe in the death penalty, but it is heartbreaking to always see how the media treats and resonds to young <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> people even as victims.</p>
       <div type="reply">
         <p><seg type="recognizing+Black+struggles">In the eyes of mainstream media, there is no such thing as a <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> victim.

         <p>While I recognize many may not appreciate this comparison, I find it to be an important one. Why? Because <seg type="call+for+direct+resistance">we have to call out the anti-<choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> racism pervasive in mainstream media and its reporting.</seg></p> <!-- I segmented this as "call for direct action" because the author directly suggest for a way to redfine Black freedom, which is to call out the racism and anti-Black narrative of the media.-->

         <p>And for those wondering, "<choice><sic>is</sic><corr>Is</corr></choice> this really about racism and anti-<choice><sic>blackness</sic><corr>Blackness</corr></choice> when <forename>Nikolas</forename>' last name is "<surname>Cruz</surname>."<corr>"</corr> Yes.

       <div type="reply">
         <p>Let's remember how the media treats young <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> people: <seg type="protecting+Black+childhood"><persName ref="BROWN">Mike Brown</persName> was a teenager referred to as a "man" to make him older than his age indicated.</seg> He was shot as he was leaving.

         <p><persName ref="PC">Philando Castile</persName> may not have been as young as <persName>Tamir Rice</persName> or <persName>Mike Brown</persName>, but had a licenced weapon and was still gunned down in front of his girlfriend and daughter.

         <p><persName ref="GAINES">Korryn Gaines</persName> was killed in <settlement>Baltimore</settlement>, <region>Md.</region> even though she was holding her son.

       <div type="reply">
         <p>Remember <persName>Jordan Davis</persName>?

         <p>Point is: <seg type="multidimensionality+of+Black+men">young <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> people are not given the chance to be victims or survivors; only perpetrators of violence.</seg> This is played out (and defended) in the media who only exacerbate this dangerous narrative.
