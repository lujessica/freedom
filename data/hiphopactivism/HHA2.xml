         <p>[Eyewitness account from <persName ref="DJ">Dorian Johnson</persName>:]<lb/>
           So now it was like the officer <supplied><persName ref="DW">Darren Wilson</persName></supplied> is pulling him inside the car and he's<lb/>
           trying to pull away. At no time the officer said that he was going<lb/>
           to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was<lb/>
           drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or, "I'm going to shoot" and in<lb/>
           the same moment, the first shot went off. We looked down and he<lb/>
           was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took off<lb/>
           running</p>

         <p>[Bridge]<lb/>
           Are we all alone, fighting on our own<lb/>
           Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance<lb/>
           Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground<lb/>
           Don't just stand around, don't just stand around</p>

         <p>[Eyewitness account from <persName ref="#DJ">Dorian Johnson</persName>:]<lb/>
           As we <supplied reason="clarification">Dorian Johnson and Michael Brown</supplied> took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was<lb/>
           fearing for my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend, <supplied reason="clarification">Michael Brown</supplied> he<lb/>
           kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared<lb/>
           for me too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out<lb/>
           of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend but<lb/>
           his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at<lb/>
           him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was<lb/>
           already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once<lb/>
           my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the<lb/>
           air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with<lb/>
           his weapon drawn and he fired 7 more shots <supplied>Indicated details with the exact number of shots</supplied> and my friend died</p>
