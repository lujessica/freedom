<h4 align="center"><i>Restructuring the Face of Crime</i></h4>

<hr>

<p>The media — whether it be due to the lack of diversity in the newsroom or incomplete reporting due to the culture of instant news — often report bracketed, stereotyped narratives that disregard the individual experience. As a result, the media, which holds immense power due to its ability to influence the public, perpetuates the historical silencing of positive Black narratives through its criminalization of the community. However, in recent years, the Black community has been able to have a strong and positive voice on digital spaces, especially Twitter, which also has been incredibly influential in the dissemination of news; thus, allowing direct resistance of the narrative. This digital archive aims to contribute to the larger conversation of redefining Black freedom as it shows the Black community challenging and correcting the single-story narrative to escape the stereotypical criminality that confines them.</p>

<p>While there are several negative portrayals of the Black community in the media, including being disproportionately portrayed as poor and lacking a father figure, I chose to focus on criminality as it correlates with the disproportionate incarceration of Black people, especially Black men, and incarceration deters freedom. Several research finds that Black people are disproportionately portrayed as aggregators and perpetrators in crime stories, while generally failing to recognize accomplishments. Color of Change reported that 75 percent of news reports about violent crime arrests in New York City — one of the most diverse and liberal cities in the country, as well as the headquarters of many news outlets — highlighted Black alleged perpetrators, when only 51 percent of those arrested were Black. Furthermore, on a larger scale, 69 percent of all crime-related news stories depicted a Black male as the perpetrator. Such representation paints a violent image of the community and defines Black people, especially Black males, as criminals. As a result, viewers and readers of the news story, which include law enforcement officials, believe the same narrative and adopt the same definition.</p>

<p>Both my texts discuss the implications of such media representation, but more importantly, present causes of or solutions to the issue. The first text, a thread of tweets by Preston Mitchum, starts with a comparison of the portrays of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy killed by cops who mistook his toy gun to be real, and Nikolas Cruz, the suspect of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, an event which was only two-days old at the time of the tweet. Mitchum mentions that while Cruz, a 19-year-old man, was described as a “broken child,” Rice was identified as a “thug.” This initial tweet set the tone for the tweets that followed in this thread, which specifically discussed media’s sympathy towards White perpetrators while it simultaneously fails to recognize the concept of Black victim as it generally portrays Black people as perpetrators. The solution to this issue that Mitchum identified was that, as a community, the anti-Black racism “pervasive in mainstream media” and its reporting must be called out, similar to how he did with this thread. Similarly, the second text, a thread by @DamnJazAgain, also discussed the shallow portrayal that excludes Black victims; however, unlike Mitchum, she went deeper as to examine the forces that hinder the Black community and called out the media to be one as, she claims, it ensures “the feminization and criminalization of the [B]lack man is a perpetuating cycle.” In general, I chose these tweets because it provides two similar, yet contrasting, perspectives to the issue. While both agree on the exclusion of Black victim narrative and the implications that such portrayal has, text two examined the issue from a broad perspective, while text one, by providing various examples, discussed the specificities of the issue and provided solutions.</p>

<p>As a journalism student, but more importantly as a person of color, the news media’s problematic representation of minorities has been an issue of importance to me and I recognize that this issue is especially critical in the representation of the Black community. Through this archive, I wanted to not only preserve the digital resistance to the discrepancies to recognize a mode of asserting freedom for the community, I also wanted to learn about and research the issue further to ensure that I, as a journalist, do not perpetuate the anti-Black narrative that currently plagues the mainstream media today.</p>
