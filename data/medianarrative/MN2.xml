    <p>The media plays a huge role in ensuring that the feminization and criminalization of the <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> man is a perpetuating cycle. <seg type="Black+innocence"> We've all seen how the news will use a mugshot for the innocent <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> man slain by police while using a picture of the <choice><sic>white</sic><corr>White</corr></choice> mass shooter petting a kitten<add>.</add></seg></p>
  <div type="reply"> <!-- I segmented this as "Black innocence" because the author is calling out how the media portrays even innocent Black people as perpetrators using old criminal record, implying that it is important that the narrative of innocence should not be tainted and if he is innocent, it should be left as just that. She is also calling for Black innocence to be highlighted more as it is always overshadowed by something negative.-->
