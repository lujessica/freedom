      <p>WE <supplied reason="clarification">The Black Population or African Americans in the United States</supplied> ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE KILLINGS OF YOUNG<lb/>
        MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES.</p>

      <p>IT IS UP TO US <supplied reason="repetition">Continuous references to a greater community through inclusive language</supplied> TO TAKE A STAND AND DEMAND THAT THEY<lb/>
        "STOP KILLING US."</p>

      <p>WE DON'T NEED SYMPATHY.<lb/>
        <seg type="justice">WE NEED EVERYONE TO RESPECT OUR LIVES.</seg></p>

      <p><seg type="safety">WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP AS A COMMUNITY AND FIGHT AGAINST<lb/>
        ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT MURDER OR ANY VIOLENT ACTION BY<lb/>
        THOSE WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US SHOULD CONSISTENTLY GO UNPUNISHED.</seg></p>

      <p>THESE ROBBERIES OF LIVES <supplied reason="clarification">The names of two specific lives are named later on, but they are not just limited to those people.</supplied> MAKE US FEEL HELPLESS AND HOPELESS<lb/>
        BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF<lb/>
        THE NEXT GENERATION, FOR THE NEXT YOUNG MEN AND<lb/>
        WOMEN WHO BELIEVE IN GOOD.</p> <!--Black lives have long been dismissed when it comes to police brutality and other discriminatory actions. Beyonce makes a point to address how lives have in a sense been stripped and taken with no consent. She also addresses that the fight needs to continue for future generations. I thought it was important to include a supplied tag to clarify that these lives will be remembered and their names will not be forgotten.!-->

      <p><seg type="equality">THIS IS A HUMAN FIGHT. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, GENDER OR SEXUAL<lb/>
        ORIENTATION. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS MARGINALIZED,<lb/>
        WHO IS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.</seg></p>

      <p>THIS IS NOT A PLEA TO ALL POLICE OFFICERS BUT TOWARD ANY HUMAN<lb/>
        BEING WHO FAILS TO VALUE LIFE. THE WAR ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND<lb/>
        ALL MINORITIES NEEDS TO BE OVER. <supplied reason="emphasize">Beyonce makes an effort to call out everyone. She includes "any human being" to suggest that anyone can take part in these actions.</supplied> </p>

      <p>FEAR IS NOT AN EXCUSE. HATE WILL NOT WIN.</p> <!--Short phrases that speak volumes. It is pretty straightforward so I did not feel the need to encode any additional comments because I have developed an appreciation for letting Black people speak in their own words without the interpretation or intervention of non-Black people.!-->

      <p><seg type="right">WE ALL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANNEL OUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION<lb/>
        INTO ACTION.</seg> WE MUST USE OUR VOICES TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS<lb/>
        AND LEGISLATORS IN OUR DISTRICTS AND DEMAND SOCIAL<lb/>
        AND JUDICIAL CHANGES.</p>

      <p>WHILE WE PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF <supplied>Beyonce brought up specific names to amplify identities and keep them relevant.</supplied> <persName ref="AS">ALTON STERLING</persName> AND <persName ref="PC">PHILANDO<lb/>
        CASTILE</persName>, WE WILL ALSO PRAY FOR AN END TO THIS PLAGUE OF INJUSTICE<lb/>
        IN OUR COMMUNITIES.</p>

      <p>CLICK IN TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN YOUR AREA.<lb/>
        YOUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD. <supplied reason="action">Beyonce ends with a plead for action among the public. She intends to make her point clear that change needs to happen in order for Black lives to improve.</supplied></p>
