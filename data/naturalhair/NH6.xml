        <note>In this article, Saidiya Hartman theorizes archival violence and its disproportionate impact on the lives of Black women. Hartman argues that archival traces and texts corroborate representations of Black women as always dead or dying, if not in relentless peril. Such violence dehumanizes Black women, not just in the historical record, but also in contemporary life. This theorizing of archival violence contributes to this digital surrogate insofar as every attempt has been made to recognize and amplify the human activities and accomplishments of Black women, with particular attention paid to their life experiences beyond suffering and pain.</note>

        <p>One promising TV trend in 2014? The abundance of natural hair, as seen on black female characters from network TV to Netflix. <name type="TV-character">Annalise Keating</name> shed her wig and shattered narrow beauty standards on <name type="TV-show">How to Get Away With Murder</name>. The inmates’ textured hairstyles inspired emotional story lines on <name type="TV-show">Orange Is the New Black</name>. In <name type="TV-show">Scandal‘s</name> season premiere, <name type="TV-character">Olivia</name> took a rest from her silky-smooth D.C. blowouts. And <name type="TV-character">Dr. Johnson’s</name> hair on <name type="TV-show">black-ish</name> is exactly like <persName ref="#TER">Tracee Ellis Ross'</persName> hair in real life: natural. Ross spoke to <orgName ref="#EW">EW</orgName> about what the boom in un-relaxed hair means to her.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="Tracee-Ellis-Ross">
        <p><persName ref="#TER">I</persName> think what is important about <persName xml:id="VD">Viola Davis</persName> taking her wig off on <name type="TV-show">How to Get Away With Murder</name> is that it illustrates that there is a mask that women are thought to have to wear. For black women, it can be a more complex mask. Our culture has created a very limited view of what beauty is and can be. I think right now television is one of the places where women are pushing up against that and saying, “You know what? I don’t need to play this game anymore in order to be considered beautiful.”</p>
        <p>My mom <persName xml:id="DR">[Diana Ross]</persName> is known for her big hair. So me embracing my big hair was not outside the frame of reference of where I come from. What I think is exciting is that to a certain extent, there is a revolution happening where black women are owning their own beauty, despite the standard of beauty that in the past has not had space for it.</p>
        <p>I think it’s huge that I’m wearing my natural hair texture on <orgName xml:id="ABC">ABC</orgName> in prime time. As <name type="TV-character">Dr. Rainbow Johnson</name> on <name type="TV-show">black-ish</name>, I think my hair is part of the reality of this woman’s life. She has four children and is an anesthesiologist and a wife. She doesn’t have a lot of time to fuss with beauty, so her look is pretty simple. I’m very conscious of how I wear my hair on the show, and yet it’s the way I wear my hair as <persName ref="#TER">Tracee</persName>. You hire me, you hire my hair and you hire my ass. It’s all coming with me.</p>
