<hr>

<p>Historically, Black individuals have been silenced and locked out of various forms of expression. Their voices have been silenced and dismissed as they had been denied access to literacy and proper education. Since traditional archives have excluded the voices of African Americans, digital spaces have become a prominent way to voice political issues and have also served as a platform for Black individuals to express themselves in defining what freedom is. With a growing digital presence in today’s society, there has been an increase in the use of online platforms which many people are using to their advantage in order to voice their opinions on important matters. In Dr. Lu’s “Reckoning with Freedom,” she details the ways in which public discourse has paved its own definition of freedom. Essentially, dominant voices have the ability to control conversations and, with it, people and ideas.</p>

<p>Ever since there has been vast availability and accessibility to online spaces, the Black community has had the opportunity to declare their ideas of freedom and inclusivity to whoever wants to listen. In Sarah Florini’s “Tweets, Tweeps, and Signifyin’,” she explores how Twitter can be used to emphasize Black oral culture through signifyin’—or deploying figurative language and wordplay to convey many layers of meaning. Black users perform their racial identities through “verbal performance, linguistic resources, and modes of interaction.” They have the ability to convey themselves in any manner, thereby influencing others and evoking reactions. From Bergis Jules’s “We’re all Bona Fide,” she discusses how Digital Blackness has helped to define its impact on the culture in including how we “understand activism in this moment, cultural expression, and surveillance of people of color online.” People with a following have the power to influence and connect with their audience. For example, Black musical artists are known for creating works of art and clearly have the ability to showcase what they want their audience to feel through their words and lyricism. As an avid music listener, I look up to artists that use their influence to promote a notable message. In this archive, I am honing in on specific ways that black musical artists have utilized digital spaces to fight for freedom and incorporate their voices into the growing movement of Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>“Black Lives Matter” is an international activist movement stemming from the African American community, which strives to fight against the violence and systemic racism towards black people. Starting in 2013, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi created the #BlackLivesMatter project in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer, George Zimmerman. This ideological and political intervention is an attempt to affirm Black humanity through the means of amplifying the names of those who have been misrepresented. Many measures have been taken to address these issues of anti-Black racism and state-sanctioned violence - most of which are taking place in online spaces. The Black Lives Matter hashtag had gained immense popularity in the Twitter realm with many prominent figures using it to express their thoughts on topics such as the concept of freedom outside and within the Black community. In light of the Black Lives Matter movement, there has been a rise in political uproar from influencers, Black musical artists, in particular, which has allowed conversations to spur and develop into well thought out debate.</p>
