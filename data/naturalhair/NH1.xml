        <note>In this article, Saidiya Hartman theorizes archival violence and its disproportionate impact
          on the lives of Black women. Hartman argues that archival traces and texts corroborate
          representations of Black women as always dead or dying, if not in relentless peril. Such violence
          dehumanizes Black women, not just in the historical record, but also in contemporary life. This
          theorizing of archival violence contributes to this digital surrogate insofar as every attempt
          has been made to recognize and amplify the human activities and accomplishments of Black women,
          with particular attention paid to their life experiences beyond suffering and pain.</note>
